## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

Here's a quick example to get you started with pyFAST:

```python
from fast import initial_seed
from fast.data import StandardScale
from fast.train import Trainer
from fast.metric import Evaluator
from fast.model import YourModel

# Initialize components
initial_seed(42)
scaler = StandardScale()
evaluator = Evaluator(['MAE', 'RMSE', 'MAPE'])

# Prepare your data
train_ds = ...  # Load or prepare your training dataset
val_ds = ...    # Load or prepare your validation dataset

# Initialize and train your model
model = YourModel(...)
trainer = Trainer(device='cuda', model=model, evaluator=evaluator)
trainer.fit(train_ds, val_ds)
```

## Data Structures

### Multiple Time Series (MTS)
   - Shape: `[batch_size, window_size, n_vars]`
   - Used for datasets with multiple variables over time.

### Univariate Time Series (UTS)
   - Shape: `[batch_size * n_vars, window_size, 1]`
   - Used for single-variable sequences.

### Data Fusion Support
   - Handles missing data with masks
   - Integrates exogenous variables
   - Supports variable-length sequences

## Benchmarking Methodology and Results

To evaluate pyFAST's performance and efficiency, we conducted benchmarking experiments on established time series datasets. We evaluated a range of models implemented in pyFAST for forecasting tasks and compared their performance against reference implementations and existing libraries. 

Our benchmarking setup involved:

**Datasets**: 
1. ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) (ETT-small variant): a benchmark for long-term forecasting
2. Electricity Load Dataset: hourly electricity consumption data
3. XMC-DC Dataset: a real-world outpatient dataset

**Baselines**: We compared against: 
1. Informer 
2. PatchTST 
3. GluonTS (DeepAR and Transformer models)

**Evaluation Metrics**: We used: 
1. MSE
2. MAE
3. RMSE
4. MAPE

**Experimental Setup**: Experiments were on a Linux server with NVIDIA GPUs, using recommended protocols and pyFAST's Trainer class with default settings. We report average performance.

### Benchmarking Results

The benchmarking results demonstrate pyFAST's competitive performance. Table 1 summarizes the forecasting performance of pyFAST models and baseline methods on the ETT, Electricity Load, and XMC-DC datasets.

We observed that pyFAST models, particularly Transformer-based architectures, exhibit strong performance on long-term forecasting tasks, while also maintaining computational efficiency due to the optimized implementations and modular design. pyFAST's modularity also allows for easy customization and adaptation of models, which can lead to further performance improvements for specific datasets and tasks.

## Code Example (Usability)

To illustrate pyFAST's usability, here is a Python code example demonstrating a typical workflow for time series forecasting using the Transformer model on the ETT dataset. This example showcases the ease of use and flexibility of the library, highlighting how users can quickly get started with time series analysis using pyFAST.

```python
from fast.data.dataset import TimeSeriesDataset
from fast.model.transformer import TransformerModel
from fast.train import Trainer
from fast.metric.metric import MeanSquaredError, MeanAbsoluteError

# Load ETT dataset
dataset = TimeSeriesDataset.from_csv('dataset/ETT/ETT-small.csv')
train_data, val_data, test_data = dataset.split([0.7, 0.2, 0.1])

# Initialize Transformer model
model = TransformerModel(
    input_size=dataset.n_vars,
    output_size=dataset.n_vars,
    seq_len=24,
    pred_len=24
)

# Define metrics and trainer
metrics = [MeanSquaredError(), MeanAbsoluteError()]
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    metrics=metrics,
    device='cuda'  # or 'cpu'
)

# Train the model
trainer.train(
    train_data=train_data,
    val_data=val_data,
    epochs=10
)

# Evaluate on test data
test_loss, test_metrics = trainer.evaluate(test_data)
print(f"Test Loss: {test_loss}")
print(f"Test Metrics: {test_metrics}")
```

This code snippet demonstrates the key steps in using pyFAST: loading a dataset, initializing a model, defining metrics, setting up the trainer, and training and evaluating the model. The modular design allows users to easily swap out different datasets, models, or metrics by modifying just a few lines of code.
