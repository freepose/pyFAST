\begin{abstract}
Modern time series analysis demands flexible, efficient, and extensible software, yet existing Python libraries often fall short, lacking modularity and support for cutting-edge models, especially for tasks like univariate forecasting and sparse data handling. To bridge this gap, we introduce \texttt{pyFAST}, a novel, research-driven Python framework that redefines modularity and efficiency in time series analysis.  \texttt{pyFAST} pioneers the integration of Large Language Model adaptations for univariate forecasting and offers native support for sparse data, alongside a comprehensive suite of state-of-the-art models, including Transformers and Graph Neural Networks.  Its unique modular architecture empowers users to seamlessly customize and extend the library, fostering rapid experimentation and methodological innovation. Benchmarking demonstrates \texttt{pyFAST}'s superior computational efficiency and competitive accuracy against leading libraries. \texttt{pyFAST} is publicly available on GitHub at \href{https://github.com/anonymous-code-for-peer-review/pyFAST}{GitHub}, implemented in PyTorch and released under the MIT license, with comprehensive documentation and examples, aiming to catalyze community contributions and accelerate advancements in time series research and applications.

\section{Introduction}
Time series analysis is indispensable across diverse domains, from financial forecasting and healthcare monitoring to environmental science and industrial predictive maintenance.  Despite the availability of powerful libraries such as TensorFlow Time Series \cite{tensorflow_ts}, GluonTS \cite{gluonts}, and PyTorch Forecasting \cite{pytorch_forecasting}, significant challenges remain in terms of modularity, flexibility, and support for cutting-edge research. Existing tools often specialize in specific model families or lack the architectural openness to incorporate novel algorithms and adapt to diverse application needs, thereby hindering rapid experimentation and innovation.  Specifically, many libraries lack native support for sparse time series data and the flexibility to easily implement and test novel model architectures, such as recent advancements in applying Large Language Models to time series forecasting. To address these gaps, we introduce \texttt{pyFAST}, a Python library explicitly designed for modularity, efficiency, and extensibility in time series analysis. \texttt{pyFAST} empowers researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive, adaptable, and high-performance toolkit that not only covers forecasting, imputation, and generative tasks but also facilitates the seamless integration of new research and custom modifications.  \texttt{pyFAST} distinguishes itself by offering research-driven flexibility, LLM-inspired models for univariate time series, native sparse data support, and a systematic approach to data preprocessing and model training, making it particularly suitable for both academic research and real-world applications in healthcare analytics, energy forecasting, and beyond.
